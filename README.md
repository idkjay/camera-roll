## Reflection

  - Camera Roll was my submission to a Mintbean hackathon that focused on creating a photo searching app. I was able to really showcase my CSS skills while demonstrating my ability to effectively use an external API. 
  
  - It wasn't an all too difficult project. We were given 4 hours to complete it. The hardest part I'd say was working with Lightbox. Ran into some minor issues implementing it as the documentation called for class syntax and I was brought up learning hooks. So I just took a little extra time translating what I wanted from class syntax into that of hooks.
